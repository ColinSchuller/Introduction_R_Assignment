This repository contains the R_Assignment for BCB546
In this assignment I created an Rmd file that contains the code to manipulate and merge two files with snp data
In this file then organized the resulting files into species specific chromosome files
Following this I graphed the snp data to show 1) SNPs per chromosome 2) Missing data and amounts of homo and heterozygosity 3) between species snp data for homo, hetero, and missing zygosities.
